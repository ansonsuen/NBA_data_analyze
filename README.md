# Model Building
Intially, dummy variables are tranformed fromcategorical variable and splited the data into train and tests sets with a test size of 20%.

I tried three different models and evaluated them using Mean Absolute Error. I chose MAE because it is relatively easy to interpret and outliers aren’t particularly bad in for this type of model.

Three models:
Multiple Linear Regression – Baseline for the model
Lasso Regression – Because of the sparse data from the many categorical variables, I thought a normalized regression like lasso would be effective.
Random Forest – Again, with the sparsity associated with the data, I thought that this would be a good fit.
